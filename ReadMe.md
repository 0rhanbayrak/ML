Data Cleaning and Classification with KNN and SVM
This project demonstrates a data preprocessing workflow and its impact on classification performance using KNN and SVM algorithms.

Step 1: Evaluate DataSet using KNN and SVM, calculate confusion matrices, and record accuracy.
Step 2: Replace 50 random values in the "age" column with NaN values to create DataSetContainsNan.
Step 3: Replace NaN values with column means to create DataSetContainsMeanInsteadOfNan.
Step 4: Re-evaluate the modified dataset using KNN and SVM, calculate confusion matrices, and compare results.
Key findings:

Both KNN and SVM exhibit slight changes in accuracy after handling NaN values.
The SVM algorithm maintains higher accuracy compared to KNN in both scenarios.
This project highlights the significance of data cleaning in machine learning workflows and its measurable impact on classification outcomes.
